# Outline

Review the data life cycle and data workflow

Present some tools in R for efficiently and effectively working with data along the life cycle

**Demonstrate a data workflow in R using an example project**


???
- What we will cover
  - Introduce some tools in R that can be used for a data workflow. 
  - We take a scientific data focus, but the tools that we introduce can be used for all types of data.

- Disclaimer: What we won't cover
  - This is not an "Intro to R", how to get your data into R, etc
    - There are many free online courses that cover these materials
      - DataCamp
      - NCTC courses
- Take home message: It is possible to use a scripting languaging like R to complete your data workflow that follows the data life cycle. Doing this is more efficient and less error prone than a manual data workflow commonly used.

- Why use R?
  - Free for everybody
  - Relatively easy to learn (compared to other programming languages)
  - Popular
  - Powerful
  - Flexible
    - statistical analyses
    - graphics
    - reporting
  - Active community of users
    - stackoverflow
    - package development
    - GitHub integration
  - Nice free integrated development environment (RStudio)

- Choose a standard file directory for your R projects

- Provides consistent relative directory paths for your scripts.

- There are R packages that provide functions that create a file directory.
    - `MakeProject::MakeProject()`
    - `rrtools::use_analysis()`
    - `refugetools::dir_create()`

- Isolated: 
  - Installing a new or updated package for one project won’t break your other projects, and vice versa. That’s because packrat gives each project its own private package library.
- Portable: 
  - Easily transport your projects from one computer to another, even across different platforms. Packrat makes it easy to install the packages your project depends on.
- Reproducible:
  - Packrat records the exact package versions you depend on, and ensures those exact versions are the ones that get installed wherever you go.

- Available tools:
  - packrat
  - rocker
    - Docker is a program that allows to manipulate (launch and stop) multiple operating systems (called containers) on your machine (your machine will be called the host).
    - you can use older versions of a package for a specific task, while still keeping the package on your machine up-to-date.

# Documenting R object

(image of commented header)
(image of Roxygen header)

???
- This is the metadata for your scripts

- In the simplest case, add a commented header to your R scripts
- For reusable functions, consider inserting an Roxygen header (Ctl-Alt-Shift-R)
    - one less step when bundling your functions into a package.


---
# Roxygen comments

- Metadata for functions
  - Describes the purpose of the function, parameter values (`@params`), what is returned (`@return`), and how to use it (`@example`)


.small[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#' Calculate estimated proportion of sites at which a species occurs
#'
#' @param topmod object of class \code{unmarkedFitOccu} for single-species 
#' occupancy model
#' @param stat statistic (\code{mean} or \code{median}) used to 
#' summarize posterior distribution
#' @param n number of sites surveyed
#'
#' @return vector containing posterior mean or median and upper and lower 95% 
#' confidence limits
#'
#' @export

#' @example calc.pao(topmod, stat = "mean", n = 30)

calc.pao <- function(topmod, stat = "mode", n){
    re = unmarked::ranef(topmod)
    EBUP = unmarked::bup(re, stat = stat)
    CI = confint(re, level = 0.95)
    PAO = c(Estimate = sum(EBUP), colSums(CI))
