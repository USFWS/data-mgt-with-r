# Document

???

Before we dig into data acquisition, processing, and analysis, we need to have 
"THE TALK". Yep, we need to talk about documentation. 

---

# Why document our code?

.pull-left[
.large[**Reproducibility**]

Make it reproducible for:

- future **you**!
]

.pull-right[

]

???

Why should we document our code? There are plenty of good reasons to document our code, but we'll focus on one --- reproducibility. It's one of criteria McCrea mentioned that we should strive for in the data management life cycle. To put it simply, if you and I start with the same set of data, and a road map for data manipulation and analysis, we should at the very least be able to arrive at the same analytical or graphical results. Arguments about whether our particular analytical road map was "correct" are independent of reproducibility. Reproducibility makes sure we can start those arguments from the same place. McCrea and I are asserting that reproducibility it much easier in a code-based workflow. What does that have to do with documentation? Well, code is written for computers. Documentation helps turn the "computer-speak" of code into human readable content so we can better understand our mutual starting point for discussion/argument. Those humans will often be your colleagues, but are more than likely to be you, some time into the future. And good documentation discourages the self-loathing that often accompanies the experience or revisiting your code 6 months after you started it...

Most of the documentation "basics" we cover are described well in these three sources, along with more rigorous documentation techniques. So we simply leave these references here for posterity. But they are worthy reads once you start down the slippery slope of a code-based workflow.

Let me hit you with all of these "basics" of documentation at once, as we'll take each in turn. But it's worth pointing out there's nothing R-specific about this list. They apply equally to your forays into Python, C++, Matlab, or any other coding program. But since this *is* a presentation about R, we'll see a brief example or two of how these basics "look" in R as we work our way through them.

.pull-right[.right[![:scale 100%](images/disturbing.jpg)]]

???

Our first stop on the documentation train is adding comments to the code you write. COmments give you the opportunity to integrate a "lab notebook" into your code. Code is written for computer understanding, comments are written for human understanding. Consider commenting your code as the bare minimum requirement of documenting your code. 

---

# Commenting R code

# Comment code as you write it

.center[[![:scale 70%](images/abstrusegoose-bridge.png)](https://abstrusegoose.com/432)]

???

But if you want to be the star student, or hate yourself later, a better approach is to provide thoughtful comments throughout the code that informs the reader, *succintly*, of your intentions. This isn't play-by-play. We don't need to rehash "what" we're doing with the code ("loading in my data"), or "how" the code is doing it ("looping over individuals"), but rather "why" we wrote any particular piece of code. What is that code intending to accomplish?

???

Comments are one very useful way to help translate the code written for computers into human-readable content. Another important way to integrate human-readable language into our code, without really impacting our software's ability to interpret that code, is to give informative names to the objects we create.

On the left...

# Follow (or at least read) a style guide

.center[[![:gen 75%, shadow](images/xkcd-code_quality.png)](https://xkcd.com/1513/)]

???

So, thoughtful commenting and informative object naming are the two main ways you can alter the content of your code to better express your intentions and goals. 

But there are several other documentation "basics" that help you to better organize your code to make it more readable and easier to troubleshoot. The first of these is straightforward---when you write code, do it with a consistent style. McCrea covered this earlier in the presentation, so consider this a friendly reminder to at least read a style guide. 

We link several in the repository associated with this presentation. Whatever style you choose, being consistent with it can dramatically improve the readability of your code, making your intentions that much easier to follow.

# Make dependencies explicit

### Package dependencies of code

- Load required packages at beginning of script


&lt;code class ='r hljs remark-code'&gt;# General usage&lt;br&gt;library(&lt;span style='background-color:#CBB5FF'&gt;package&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# Example&lt;br&gt;library(&lt;span style='background-color:#CBB5FF'&gt;dplyr&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;

---
# Make dependencies explicit

### Function dependencies (package source)

- Identify the package source of used functions
- Avoids conflicts when multiple packages share function names 


&lt;code class ='r hljs remark-code'&gt;# General usage&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style='background-color:#CBB5FF'&gt;package&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span style='background-color:#FFDFD1'&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# Examples&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style='background-color:#CBB5FF'&gt;rio&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span style='background-color:#FFDFD1'&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style='background-color:#CBB5FF'&gt;dplyr&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span style='background-color:#FFDFD1'&gt;mutate&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;

---

# Modularize your code

- Separate scripts for separate tasks

- Execute or load the functionality with the `source` function


```r
source("code/00_load_dependencies.R")
source("code/01_import_data.R")
source("code/02_tidy_data.R")
source("code/03_fit_regression_models.R")
source("code/04_generate_figures.R")
source("code/05_generate_report.R")
```

???

It's much easier to navigate through code that has been divided into multiple scripts that perform a focused, specific purpose. This is compared to, say, generating a single script that sequentially proceeds through much of the data management lifecycle. Even the best documentation in the world isn't going to make such a script digestible or easy to navigate.

In R, we can execute the code, or load the functionality of the code, in these separate, modular scripts with the `source` function.

]

???

Regardless of whether we modularize our code, repeating code (or very nearly repeating code) is a common occurrence. Often we want to perform similar actions, make similar data transformations, generate similar plots, or repeat analyses. Well, in the spirit of avoiding long scripts, and breaking your code up into more manageable, modular chunks, consider turning those sections of repetitive code into functions.

In R, the general structure of functions look like...

---
count: false


```r
source("code/functions/createAwesomePlot.R")
figure_2 &lt;- createAwesomePlot(data = bird_counts, outpath = "output/birds_plot.png")
figure_3 &lt;- createAwesomePlot(data = veg_data, output = "output/veg_plot.png")
```

.center[![:scale 50%](images/function.jpg)]

???

It's extremely satisfying to write a stand-alone function, `source`ing that functionality into R, and then performing some task with a line of code. It's easier to troubleshoot too...

# Documentation for (nearly) free!

- Automated documentation tools
- [`roxygen2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html)
  - specialized comments (`#'`) translated into documentation

.center[![:scale 50%](images/false.jpg)]

???

While we're on the topic of turning repetitive code into functions, let's bring up another perk beside easier maintenance and the satisfaction of calling your own functions - automated documentation tools

Since you'd be commenting your functions anyway (right?), R has a handy package (roxygen2) that allows you turn basically turn your comments into standardized, human readable, html documentation. You accomplish this through the use of a special comment character (roxygen comment) and a few special tags (e.g., to identify the parameters, product, and examples, etc. of your function)

2. Demonstrate how to use your code (install, configure, find help)

3. What your code looks like in action (examples)

4. Other relevant details (license, acknowledgments, working environment)

---
# Include a README file

### Handy templates available

- e.g., [`usethis::use_readme_rmd`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_readme_rmd.html)

### Bonus points: create a [vignette](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html)

# Put documentation under version control

- Stays "synced" with code as it changes

.center[![:scale 60%](images/dangerous.jpg)]


???

The same benefits of putting your code under version control (with Git/Github for example)
apply to the documentation. When code and the documentation change substantially, you
retain a record of all past versions and can better manage keeping your documentation in step with your code.

# Acquire

???

On to data acquisition. In our current context of a code-based workflow, we're not referring to the actual collection of data, say, as a part of field work in a biological monitoring program.(REFERENCE EARLIER WEBINAR RE DIGITATL DATA COLLECTION?) We're referring in this case to the act of retrieving the data that you've toiled to collect and bringing it into R so we can process it, quality control it, visualize it, analyze it, report on it, and share and archive it.

We distinguish generally between three sources of the data that you might reasonably want to bring into R: flat file databases (things like csvs, Excel and Google spreadsheets, fixed width), relational databases (e.g., Microsoft Access, SQL Server, etc), or data that sitting behind a web API (either open or secured). For flat files and relational databases, R doesn't generally care if that file is sitting on your machine or on a server somewhere as long as ou can construct a path to it.

We simply don't have time to tackle these in depth, so we'll focus on a handy R package for getting data in flat files into R as well as demonstrate that one can pull directly from ArcGIS online into R.

We won't dwell long on relational databases, but there is flexibility. In general, SQL-based options are well-supported. And with the `dplyr` r package that we'll see again later, there's functionality to perform SQL actions in place prior to pulling the data into memory. Getting data directly from Access is an issue, so the best option there is generally to export flat files from Access and work with those...

Another useful way for us to access data is though a web API service. Put simply, an API is any interface in which we can use a set of programming functions to access features or data from some application. In a web API, that service sits on the web, and we access via HTTP protocols. 

We expect that data access, storage, and archiving via web APIs will become commonplace. For example, we are starting to see more and more of our biological inventory and monitoring work hosted on services like ArcGIS online

For the purposes of this webinar, there is simply too much to cover, so we'll focus on a couple of points. 

FIrst, some web APIs we're likely to find useful have existing dedicated R packages. Services like USGS's ScienceBase (which McCrea will illustrate later), eBird, iNaturalist, FishBase, online biodiversity repositories like GBIF and BISON, as well as ITIS, our taxonomic information system.

But there are plenty of other APIs we're likely to find useful that don't have existing R packages, and we may be interested in setting up access on our own. Services like AGOL...

THere are a couple of handy packages to help you with passing the necessary HTTP requests, like the `httr` and `crul` packages. Although I'll note the  `crul` package is aimed more at developers than casual users.

One complication is that while most web APIs use the same HTTP requests (so most can be accessed using the `httr` package, for example), the format of those requests varies from API to API, and some are more complicated than others. But the rewards for getting it to work can be substantial to a complete code-based workflows. Let's take ArcGIS Online as an example, which the FWS is using increasingly for digital data collection, storage, and archiving of wildlife survey and monitoring data.

# Data reshaping

.center[[![:gen 60%](images/wide-long.png)](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/)]

???
First, let's talk a bit about tabular data.

We can present it in two distinct forms: wide and long.

In 'wide' format, each sample/individual get a row, and each variable of interest occupies a column. This can be a useful format for recording data, and often for analyzing data.

In 'long' format, that 'wide' data is pivoted such that all recorded values for that sample/individual occupy a column, and there's an associated column providing the variable "context" for that value. This can be a useful format for summarizing and visualizing data.

So an important data processing task is to reshape data from one form to the other.

# QA/QC with assertive programming

- Test explicit assumptions/expectations
- Play QA/QC offense, not defense
- [`assertr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/assertr/index.html) ([vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/assertr/vignettes/assertr.html))


```r
# Expect maximum weight
mammals %&gt;% assertr::verify(weight &lt; 100)

# Alternative, giving weight range
mammals %&gt;% assertr::assert(assertr::within_bounds(15, 100), weight)

# Confirm expected format of sex variable
mammals %&gt;% assertr::assert(assertr::in_set(c("M", "F")))
```

???
Data interrogation and data profiling examples we just covered are a nice, graphical way to test your assumptions and expectations about your data. But they're a bit ad hoc. If we're familiar with the data we're using, or what we expect it to look like up front, then we can be more explicit and assertive so that you can detect and correct any deviations from that expectation as soon as possible in your workflow. That is, we can be on offense in our data QA/QC, rather than playing defense.

The `assertr` package gives us a suite of functions designed to verify our assumptions about the data as early as possible.

A few simple examples. So many more possibilities --&gt; vignette

# Exploratory data analysis

- More thoughtful and intentional than data profiling
- Aims for understanding
  - variation, missing values, covariation
- Iterative (questions -&gt; answers -&gt; questions)
- Visualization is key

???
Once we're past the data profiling and QA/QC, we can start looking to better understand our data with exploratory data analysis.

# Visualization framework

- Need flexible but consistent grammar for visualization
  - [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html): a grammar of graphics	
  
.center[![:genv 375px, shadow](images/ggplot-layers.png)]

???
Graphics are built by layering independent elements, such as:
  - data
  - aesthetic mapping (position, color, fill, shape, size, linetype, etc.)
  - geometric object (points, lines, bars, rasters, etc.)
  - scales
  - faceting (separate graphics by groups)
  - coordinate systems
  - labels
  - themes
...among others 

There are alternative visualization tools in R, but we appreciate the flexibility and intuitiveness of ggplot, and how quickly you can go from data to publication quality figures. We could spend a solid week on ggplot, so we'll restrict the demonstration to a quick example of the building of a plot using the layers, as well as show you a few figures created by ggplot to illustrate the range of possibilities. Couple that with the relative ease of turning ggplot-based figures into animations and interactive graphics

# Analyze

???

We can't reasonably spend much time here because there's simply too much material. So we'll focus on a few good resources to lead you down the right code-based path in R for whatever analysis you're looking for. The good news is that, if it can be done, there's likely an R resource available.
