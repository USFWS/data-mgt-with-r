Hello and welcome to "R Tools for a Code-based Data Workflow"! 

As mentioned, my name is McCrea Cobb. I am a biometrician for the Inventory and Monitoring Program within the National Wildlife Refuge Sytem, and I am located in Anchorage, Alaska. I am co-presenting with Adam Smith, who is quantitative ecologist with the I&amp;M program based in Athens, Georgia.

At the bottom of this slide, you can find a link to our GitHub repository that contains this presentation and more R resources.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

# Outline

#### Review the data life cycle and data workflow


???
First, we will **review** the data and project life cycles introduced earlier today by Jared and Maren and then discuss how these models fit into a scientific data workflows. We will **compare** what we're calling the **traditional** workflow that involves manually manipulating data using propritary software, to a **code-based** data workflow using R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics.

???
Before starting though, we should include a **disclaimer**. It can be **frustrating** trying to learn a new language like R. Much like learning to draw well, you cannot learn R in a hour and a half. If we tried to do this today, it might come across like **this**. 

**Be warned** that this webinar is not an "Introduction to R" or a "How to get your data into R" or "Learn the Tidyverse". We have included links in the slides to additional resources and we encourage you to visit our github site where there are many more additional resources listed. If you are interested in learning R, there are many courses that cover these materials, from online courses from DataCamp or in-person courses through NCTC courses (CSP1004 Data Wrangling in R)

Our **message** is simply: it is possible to use a scripting languaging like R to complete a scientific data workflow that largely mirrors the data life cycle. We believe that this approach is often more efficient and reproducible, and less error prone than the traditional point and click approach to managing data.

# Project and data life cycles

.center[![:scale 80%](images/life_cycles.png)]


???
As I mentioned, the project and data life cycles that Jared and Maren introduced in the previous webinar on data management will be our guide for introducing R tools. 

As you can see here, both the data and project life cycles start with a **Planning** step, and so we will start with recommended actions that we think should be considered during the planning step, and cover some associated tools in R.


---
background-image: url(images/life_cycles-data.png)

After that, we will progress through th rest of the data life cycle: starting with the Acquire step, and moving through the Process, Analyze, Share and Achive steps. We will also cover documenting in R.

# <i class="fas  fa-times " style="color:red;"></i> Traditional data workflow


???
Ok. So how are these steps typically accomplished? Let's first walk through the traditional data workflow that is probably familiar to everybody here.


---
background-image: url(images/traditional_workflow_1.png)
background-size: 90%
class: hide-logo
# <i class="fas  fa-times " style="color:red;"></i> Traditional data workflow


???
First, you start with data. These could be paper datasheets, maybe some data that were collected using a mobile app like Collector or Survey123, or data that you found in a online repository like ServCat or data.gov. 


---
background-image: url(images/traditional_workflow_2.png)
background-size: 90%
class: hide-logo
# <i class="fas  fa-times " style="color:red;"></i> Traditional data workflow


???
The first step is to acquire these data. This is generally done by digitizing paper data into Excel, Access or ArcGIS; and downloading data from a repository by navigating to their webpage in your browser. 


---
background-image: url(images/traditional_workflow_3.png)
background-size: 90%
class: hide-logo
# <i class="fas  fa-times " style="color:red;"></i> Traditional data workflow


???
Next, these data are processed and quality-checked using these same software. Occasionally, data might be imported into R for processing, and then exported as the clean dataset with a new name like "data_clean.csv" for version control and to differentiate it from the raw data.


---
background-image: url(images/traditional_workflow_4.png)
background-size: 90%
class: hide-logo
# <i class="fas  fa-times " style="color:red;"></i> Traditional data workflow


???
Data are then analyzed using a suite of software. For spatial data, this step is often done in ArcGIS. For exploratory data analysis of non-spatial data, this might be a accomplished using Excel or Access. More complex analyses might require the user to convert the data to a csv, load it into R, run from models, and write CSV tables of results.

background-size: 90%
class: hide-logo
# <i class="fas  fa-times " style="color:red;"></i> Traditional data workflow <i class="fas  fa-frown-open "></i>


???
Producing a report and presentation of these results requires the user to write text in a Word or Powerpoint files. Then, ArcGIS, Excel, Powerpoint, and R are used to create figures and tables that are often saved as JPG files.

To merge the text with the figures and tables, the user is required to manually copy and paste the images into the Word or Powerpoint document.


---
class: center, middle, hide-logo
background-image: url("images/workflow_criteria.png")
background-size: contain

???
So is this is a "good" data workflow? To evaluate this, we need criteria from which to measure success. Luckily, we have some criteria that Jared and Maren introduced earlier today. Let's evaluate the traditional data workflow using these criteria. 
 
- First, is it is reproducible? Not really. If someone else were attempting to reproduce this effort, they might not know which data were used to generate the figures and tables, and without that, they are unlikely to be able to consistently produce the same output. 

- Is it replicable? Unlikely. Even the person that completed the workflow might have trouble replicating the same steps for the next year's annual report.

- Is it documented? Perhaps if there was a complete record of all the steps, but it is unlikely. I can tell you that never did that.

- Is it efficient? No, it is heavily relient on manual repetive tasks. Humans are much slower than computers. 

- Is it robust to error? Not really. Each manual step introduced the potential for human-caused errors. Any potential software updates compound this problem.

- Is it scalable? No. Every time that new data are generated or the original data change, then the workflow breaks and needs to be restarted, often from the Acquire step.

So based on these criteria, this workflow does not appear to do well.

Ok, so is there a better way??

- What we need is a seamless and integated workflow like this guy's breakfast, where data effortlessly move from hand to mouth.

This is where R comes in. Let's take a look at a code-based workflow in R.

# <i class="fas  fa-check " style="color:green;"></i> ![:scale 7%](images/Rlogo.svg) data workflow 


???
To start, the input data are often the same, although eliminating paper datasheets can eliminate transcription error and, as we will touch on later, allows us to acquire data in R directly through web services.

background-image: url(images/r_workflow_3.png)
background-size: 90%
class: hide-logo
# <i class="fas  fa-check " style="color:green;"></i> ![:scale 7%](images/Rlogo.svg) data workflow


???
As we will show, R can directly import data from a variety of sources. This is now easier than ever thanks to a number of R package that provide flexible data import functions, including functions for spatial data.

# <i class="fas  fa-check " style="color:green;"></i> ![:scale 7%](images/Rlogo.svg) data workflow


???
R offers a number of tools for quality control, including both passive data profiling and active assertive programming approaches. 

More to come on that. 

Where R starts to really shine is tidying up messy data, and there are a whole suite of packages called the "tidyverse" that address this need.

# <i class="fas  fa-check " style="color:green;"></i> ![:scale 7%](images/Rlogo.svg) data workflow

R was originally developed as a statistical software, and there are now too many packages to even start listing, which allow for an ever growing number of analytical approaches.

???
Maybe less known is the ability to generate reports using a mixture of text and R code. Let me repeat that: **you can now produce reports and presentations from R** without needing Word or Powerpoint. Recently, a number of packages have been developed to address this need that we will touch on.

???
These code-based reports can be saved in variety of file format; including html, PDF and Word files. Even more importantly, it is possible to archive these data and data products back to repositories from R, thereby pleasing your data managers and **closing the data life cycle loop**.

Last but not least, by coding these steps all within an R environment, it is possible to wrap up these steps into a reusable R package that that is fully documented.

This presentation obviously focused on R and RStudio, which is a integrated development environment (IDE) for R to develop and share work.

But why R? Here's a few reasons:

R is:
- Free
- Relatively easy to learn (compared to other programming languages)
- Flexible and allows for:
  - statistical analyses
  - graphics
  - reporting
- Has a nice integrated development environment (RStudio) that integrates well with GitHub
- Popular (2+ millions users)
    - Active community of users
    -  Users have created over 15,000 packages that provide functions for just about any task that you can think ofp
- GitHub integration

### <i class="fas  fa-sitemap "></i> Chose a standardized working directory structure

- [`rrtools::use_analysis()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rrtools/versions/0.1.0)

There are many decision that need to be made when starting a project that involves data. One of the first of these is how to organize your work. While not necessarily a data management issue, having a standardized project directory has advantages when using a code-based workflow.

Project-oriented workflows are self-contained workflows enabling reproducibility. Ideally a collaborator or the next biologists should be able to rerun a project without changing any code or files. File paths should be workstation-independent. 

R has options for enabling project-oriented workflows in their coding environments, and RStudio projects allow for analyses to be contained in a single working directory that can be given to a collaborator and run without changing file directory paths. 

The figure on the right shows an example of a working directory file structure. Notice that data produced by the project are stored in a folder called data. Centralizing data like this makes the file paths in R consistent, and it also makes it straightforward when it comes to documenting and archiving these data. Additionally, all R code are stored in a `code` folder. Therefore the relative paths between the code and the data is consistent. Using this standardized approach allows you to more easily reuse code that rely on relative paths.

There are tools in R that can produce a standardized directory structure. Unfortunately, we don't have time today to explore these, but I've included links here to resources where you can learn more about them.

You might hear your data manager tell you that it **doesn't matter** what you name your files, as long as they are full documented and securely archived. This is true. Although descriptive file names might not be **required** for data management, there are **advantages** to having a standardized file naming convention for R project management. Descriptive file names are an important part of **organizing, sharing, and keeping track** of data files.

Generally, you should strive to call files what they are, keep file names short, avoid spaces and special characters (which might not play well with some software), and use a standard for dates such as ISO 8601. 

Settling on a standard and sticking to it for your work is good practice. The figure on the right shows a few common naming standards, such as camel case and snake case.

Sticking to a standard allows you to do things in R that would be difficult otherwise, such as programmically filtering files, as shown at the bottom left. The code imports a list of data files but excluded those containing 2016 or 2017. Without standardized file names, these types of functions would be more challenging.

In addition to deciding on a standardized file naming convention, we use the planning stage to settle on a **consistent coding syntax**. Again, this is not a requirement for good data management, and you can probably go through life without it, but it **sure makes things easier to read**. Do it for your **future self** and anyone else who has to suffer through your code!

If you are newer to R, we recommend consulting a **style guide**. There are a number of them out there, and I list a few of the more popular ones for R here. 

If you are **past the planning stage** and are struggling to make sense of ugly code, you're in luck! There is an R package called `styler` that has functions to read through and clean up code to a standard of your choosing. Another package called `lintr` will perform on the fly checking to confirm that you are conforming to the style guide. Links to more information about these packages are included here.

Let's take a closer look at the `styler` package.

After loading the `styler` package, we can run the `style_text` function to clean things up. The code at the bottom right now includes the commonly used **left arrow** for assignment, consistent spacing, and each of the piped functions are on their own lines. Much better!

I should note that `styler` also includes a Rstudio Add-in that allows you to use a drop down menu to access these functions as well.

An R project should be: 

1. **Isolated**
2. **Portable**
3. **Reproducible**

- [`rocker` package](https://www.rocker-project.org/)

???
Let's talk about about dependencies.. Ideally, a data project should totally independent, meaning that it is **isolated, portable and reproducible**. By addressing potential sources of dependencies during the planning step, you will save your future self and the next biologists a lot of heartache later on. 

By **"isolated"**, I mean that installing a new or updated package for one project won’t break other projects, and vice versa. 

**Portability** refers to the ease of transporting projects from one computer to another, even across different platforms. 

To be **reproducible** means that it is clear to everybody which software versions are required to successfully rerun code. When new versions come out, they might not be backward compatible and certain functions might no longer be available. 

There are a couple of R packages that address project dependency. One is called `packrat`, and I will cover that one in more detail here in a minute. 

Another is called `rocker`, which interfaces R with **Docker**. Docker is a program that allows you to launch multiple virtual operating environments (called **containers**) on your machine. By doing this, you can **run older versions of a package** for a specific task, while still keeping the package on your machine up-to-date.

Packrat is an R package that allows you to store your package dependencies in your working directory, instead of relying on your personal R library that is generally buried elsewhere on your computer. Therefore, when you share your project, you are also sharing all the required packages that your project depends on. This makes your project isolated and portable. Packrat also records the exact package versions you depend on, and therefore ensures those exact versions are the ones that get installed wherever you go.

There are two ways to start using packrat. If you are in the planning stage and just starting a new project, and are using RStudio (sorry eMac fans), it is as simple as checking the box at the bottom of the window to "Use packrat with this project". 

Alternatively, if you want to add packrat to an existing project, you need to install and load packrat, and then run the `init` function, as shown on the right. To add a package to packrat, you install the package as your normally would, but instead it installs into your working directory. You can then save your changes using the `snapshot` function.

Version control is the processes and tools designed to keep track of multiple different versions of data, including data products. It can be as **simple** as renaming the updated files to as **complex** as a distributed version control system like Git. Whatever the level of complexity, it is **important** to consider what version control system that a project will be using during the *planning stage* of your project.

You are welcome to use whatever version control system work best for you. That said, there are a number of advantages to using a distributed version control system like Git in combination with the associated website called GitHub. I've listed some of them here. 

If you are using RStudio, using Git and GitHub is relatively straightforward. Unfortunately, I don't have time to run through the steps, but I've included some references to get you started. One of these is a presentation that I recently gave to the Great Lakes R Working Group that introduced Git and GitHub for FWS biologists.

# Literate programming

**Allows for:**
- Code to be directly inserted into document
- Multiple outputs
- Easy to use
- Increased reproducibility
- Fewer sources of errors

???
As I touched on earlier, scientific writing and coding were traditionally separate activities. As such, a scientist who wanted to use code to generate a figure for her report would have the code for generating that figure in **one** file, and the document itself in **another**. This presents a challenge for **reproducibility**, and keeping track of where each piece of data came from and whether it's up-to-date. 

**“Literate programming”** provides an alternative approach, whereby code and text are interspersed within a single file. This file can be processed by software to produce documents with the output of the code (e.g. figures, tables, and summary statistics) automatically interwoven with the document’s body text. The most common literate programming file format in R is call RMarkdown.

Unlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. It’s quickly becoming the writing standard for academics and scientists. This approach has several additional advantages. For one, the code output of a literate programming document is by definition guaranteed to be consistent with the code in the document’s source. At the same time, literate programming can make it easier to develop analyses by reducing the separation between writing and coding.

That's all well and good, but how does it work? 

Well, unless you really want to get into the weeds...given our time constrainst today, let's just say that it's works like magic! 

As shown here, an Rmarkdown document is created by adding text and what's called "chunks" of code. You then run the **`knit`** function on the file. Magic happens and you can celebrate the percieved wizardy. A document is output in the file format that you specified, which is generally an html, Word, or PDF file.

Ok ok. Let's get under the hood a little bit more. So what does an RMarkdown file contain? There are two required sections: a header and the main body. As shown here, a simple header (written in YAML- Yet Another Markup Language) generally contains some metadata and the desired file output.

Headers can get more complex as the documents gets more customized. For example, this one includes input parameters **(`params`)** that allow the user to customize the content of the report based on their input values. In this report, the user can select the year of data and refuge station on which to generate a report.

Ok, now for the final and arguably the most important step that is often overlooked in the data life cycle: archiving. For a typical FWS data project, this step usually entails uploading your raw data, the code required to reproduce your results, and your data products to a secure repository.

Typically the process to do this is to visit a repository website, log in with your credentials, create a new record, and then manually upload data and metadata to that record. We all know that this is the right thing to do, but isn't it a pain! Wouldn't it be nice to be able to do this using some additional lines of code?

Well, I'm here to tell you that **it is possible** to do all of this programmically in R!

Just as Adam discussed about R's ability to *acquire* data from remote repositories, the opposite is also true; R code can also be used to *archive* your data and products to a remote secure repository.

I will admit though that although it is *possible* to use web services to get, put and delete data in a remote repository, this is often *not as straightforward* as some of the others steps that we've covers today. For many repository, this involves using R to interact with web services. If your not familiar with the terms "REST" and "API", you might be in for a wild ride! We will not be covering these topics today.

Because of this barrier, developers have built *custom R packages* that make it much easier to transfer data to and from scientific data repositories.

There are many R package that include functions to **acquire** data from repositories. Unfortunately though, there are much fewer R packages that include functions to **archive** data. 

Some of the more notable for which R packages can **fully interface** with repositories are:

**Zenodo**. Zenodo is an open repository for scientific data based at CERN in Swizerland. A nice bonus is that Zenodo also mints DOIs. Their API allows for uploading, searching and downloading files. The R package is also named `zenodo`. 

**FigShare**. FigShare is online open-access repository where researchers can preserve and share their research outputs; including figures, datasets, images, and videos. The R package that interfaces with FigShare is called, not too surprisingly, `rfigshare`.

To get started, you first install and load the `sbtools` package. To create a new record in ScienceBase, you first need to log-in as an authenticated user. You do this with the `authenticate_sb` function.

Once logged in, you then create a new record by running the `item_create` function, highlighted here. In this example, we creating a new record called `new test item` and assigning it as an object in R called `new_item`.

]

Edit a record:
.smaller[

&lt;code class ='r hljs remark-code'&gt;# Give the item a new title&lt;br&gt;edited_item &lt;- &amp;nbsp;&lt;span style='background-color:#ffff7f'&gt;item_update&lt;/span&gt;(new_item, list(title = "new updated item"))&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;# Append data to the item&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style='background-color:#ffff7f'&gt;item_append_files&lt;/span&gt;(edited_item, "test.dat")&lt;/code&gt;
]
]


???
We can update the metadata associated with the record using the `item_update` function.

We can then append data to the record using the `item_append_files` function. In this example, we are archiving a file called `test.dat`.

Ok. So that's the quick and dirty overview on how to archive data in ScienceBase from R. To complete the data life cycle loop, let's look at how the package can then be used to access data. 

To do this, we can access a record using the `item_get` function and take a look at what's in it. In this example, our record contains metadata about a moose survey at Tetlin Refuge in Alaska.

Finally, once we have accessed a record in ScienceBase, it is pretty straightforward to take a look at the data. In this example, I was interested in looking the spatial extent of the survey. The `item_get_wfs` function allows us to download a spatial data layer using ScienceBase's Web Feature Service. I can then view the resulting spatial polygon dataframe using R's `leaflet` package. From this, we can see that the study area encompasses a large area in eastern Alaska that extends beyond the boundary of Tetlin Refuge. It is in fact the boundary of a state game management unit.

Ok. That concludes our presentation on R tools for a code-based workflow! We hope that we were successful in demonstrating that features and packages in R allow for a contained data workflow that closely follows a data life cycle model. 

Of course, we barely scratched the surface! For more information, check out the many links in our slides that can be found on our GitHub repository. The site also include some bonus content!

I will now pass it back to Adam, who will demonstate how the concepts and tools that we've covered can be applied to a real-word case study focused on mobile acoustical bat monitoring.

Back to you Adam.
