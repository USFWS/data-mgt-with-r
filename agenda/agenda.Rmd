This webinar provides a brief introduction into using R to develop a code-based workflow for ecological survey data. Participants will learn about the advantages of using a scripting language like R for moving data along the data life cycle. We will walk through an example of using R to manage scientific data.

# Outline

1. Data life cycle review
2. The manual data workflow
    + Example
    + Limitations
3. The code-based data workflow
    + Advantages
        + Documented
        + Reproducible
        + Replicable
        + More efficient
        + Less error-prone
4. A data workflow with R
    + **Planning** an RStudio project
        + Make an R project self contained and portable
            + File directory structure
            + Relative paths
        + Dependency management
            + packrat
        + Standardize file naming convention
        + Organizing R files (Numeric preface in the names of ordered scripts)
        + Recommended RStudio settings
            + E.g., Uncheck "restore .RData into workspace at startup"
        + Version control
            + Storing versions
            + Collaboration
    + **Acquiring** data
        + local and remote
    + Scripting best practices
        + code commenting
    + **Documenting** data and scripts with R
        + rOxygen 
        + R documentation file
    + **Processing**
    + **Sharing**
        + Reporting
            + RMarkdown, shiny??
    + **Archiving**
        + Saving results to ServCat or some other data repository
5. An example project

**The list below is taken from https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-data-in-the-tidyverse**:

1. Explore your data
    - Import
    - Dealing with missing values
    - Exploratory data analysis (glimpse and skim)
2. Tame your data
    - Cast column types
    - Recode values
    - Select variables
    - Tame variable names
    - Rename variables to convention (janitor package)
3. Tidy your data
4. Archiving
