This webinar provides a brief introduction into using R to develop a code-based workflow for ecological survey data. Participants will learn about the advantages of using a scripting language like R for moving data along the data life cycle. We will walk through an example of using R to manage scientific data.

# Outline

1. Quick review of the data life cycle steps
2. Overview 
3. Advantages of a code-based data workflow
    + Documented
    + Reproducible
    + Replicable
    + More efficient
    + Less error-prone
4. Describe the typical steps:
    + Develop scripts using packaged functions
    + Wrap scripts in custom functions
    + Develop a package to house, document, and reuse custom functions
5. Run through an example
