This webinar provides a brief introduction into using R to develop a code-based workflow for ecological survey data. Participants will learn about the advantages of using a scripting language like R for moving data along the data life cycle. We will walk through an example of using R to manage scientific data.

# Outline

1. Quick review of the data life cycle steps
2. Overview 
3. Advantages of a code-based data workflow
    + Documented
    + Reproducible
    + Replicable
    + More efficient
    + Less error-prone
4. Describe the typical steps:
    + Develop scripts using packaged functions
    + Wrap scripts in custom functions
    + Develop a package to house, document, and reuse custom functions
5. Run through an example


# *(Questions)*

- What is the take-home message from the webinar? You can (and should) use R entirely for your data workflow? 
    - Demonstate how R can be used for the data life cycle process
    - A good clear demo of this.
    - Show the endpoint first. The pie in the sky.
        - Example: SppDistMonProj, mobile aucistic recorder package
            - **look for other example**
            - **meet on Wed to discuss**
        
- How do we want to collaborate on this? Through GitHub? If so, how? Separate branches or forked?
    - **GitHub is a good option**
    - **McCrea will work off master branch, Adam will fork**
    - **Keep work distinct in the repo**

- Do we want to use the SppDistMonProj package as the example? What other examples do we have?

- Should we attempt to include any class participation? If so, what format?
    - **Probably not enough time.**
    
- Should we focus on the tidyverse?
    - **Doesn't really apply**

- Version control?
    - **repo is available for the webinar, we can then mention GitHub and version control**

- Rmarkdown for generating our presentation slides? Flipbook is pretty cool for incrementally describing code.
    - **rmarkdown**
    - **Send template to Adam**
    - **McCrea will send project file dir template to Adam**


# *(Topics Ideas)*

**The list below is taken from https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-data-in-the-tidyverse**:

1. Explore your data
    - Import
        - **Add Adam to the SppDistMonProj AGOL**
        - **Adam will look into accessing Survey123 data using R**
    - Dealing with missing values
    - Summarize data (glimpse and skim)
2. Tame your data
    - Cast column types
    - Recode values
    - Select variables
    - Tame variable names
    - Rename variables to convention (janitor package)
3. Tidy your data
4. Archiving
