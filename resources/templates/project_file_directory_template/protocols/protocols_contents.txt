Instructions for Protocol Template_Ver2.0_508Compliant (.doc)
	This document provides instructions for using the template 
	(version 2.0) for drafting survey protocols used in the National 
	Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS). Survey protocols are written to 
	guide inventory and monitoring (I&M) of NWRS resources to completion, 
	provide reliable and relevant survey results for decision making, and 
	document practices for consistent implementation over time, by multiple 
	parties (701 FWS 2, FWS 2013a). Guidance on the definitions, contents 
	and format of inventory and monitoring protocols can also be found in 
	How to Develop a Survey Protocol: A Handbook (Survey Protocol Handbook; 
	FWS 2013a). NWRS survey protocols address eight basic elements that guide 
	survey implementation (FWS 2013a: 4), and three other sections for 
	presenting guidance, Appendices, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
	and Supplemental Materials (SMs). This template is arranged in the 
	same order as described in the Survey Protocol Handbook. Labels and 
	case of two headings were modified from those in the handbook.
